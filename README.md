#Heart Disease EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to visualize and analyze various factors related to heart disease using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal of this project is to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data through different types of visualizations.

Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
Types of Visualizations
In this project, we utilize the following types of visualizations:

DistPlot (Age Distribution)
Pie Charts (Categorical Columns Distribution)
ViolinPlot (Gender and Heart Disease Distribution)
HeatMap (Correlation Matrix)
PairPlot (Pairwise Relationships)
JointPlot (Correlation between Variables)
These visualizations provide insights into various factors affecting heart disease, such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate.

Project Breakdown
1. Heart Disease EDA - Age (DistPlot)
The DistPlot is used to visualize the distribution of the age variable. This plot includes a histogram and kernel density estimate (KDE) to show the age distribution in the dataset. It reveals that the majority of the data points fall between the ages of 40 and 70 with a minimum age of around 30 and a maximum age of 80.

2. Heart Disease EDA - Categorical Columns (Pie Charts)
Pie Charts are used to show the distribution of categorical variables. In this case, we analyze the distribution of gender within the dataset. The pie chart shows that 79% of individuals with heart disease are male, while 21% are female.

3. Heart Disease EDA - ViolinPlot
The ViolinPlot provides a combined box plot and kernel density estimate (KDE), showing the probability density of heart disease across different gender groups. This plot demonstrates that males are more likely to suffer from heart disease compared to females.

4. Heart Disease EDA - Correlation (HeatMap)
The Correlation HeatMap is used to visualize the correlation matrix, which shows the relationship between numerical variables in the dataset. The heatmap uses color intensity to represent the correlation strength, with darker colors indicating stronger correlations. This is helpful for identifying which features are highly correlated.

5. Heart Disease EDA - Correlation (PairPlot)
The PairPlot shows pairwise relationships between numerical variables. It includes scatter plots for variable pairs and histograms for individual variables. This matrix helps identify potential correlations between different features and highlights patterns that could be useful for analysis or modeling.

6. Heart Disease EDA - Correlation - JointPlot
The JointPlot provides a combined view of the relationship between two variables. It includes a scatter plot with a regression line and individual histograms (or KDEs) on each axis. This type of plot is particularly useful for understanding how one variable affects another, such as how Cholesterol affects MaxHR (Maximum Heart Rate).

Results and Insights
Age Distribution: The dataset contains individuals between the ages of 30 and 80, with a concentration between 40 and 70.
Gender Distribution: A higher percentage of males (79%) are affected by heart disease in this dataset.
Heart Disease by Gender: The violin plot shows a greater prevalence of heart disease among males compared to females.
Correlation Analysis: The heatmap and pairplot help identify important relationships, such as cholesterol levels and max heart rate.
Cholesterol vs MaxHR: The jointplot visualizes how cholesterol levels correlate with maximum heart rate.

Conclusion
This project provides a deep dive into the exploratory data analysis of a heart disease dataset. By visualizing key relationships between different variables, we gain insights into how age, gender, cholesterol levels, and other factors contribute to heart disease. Data visualizations like the DistPlot, Pie Charts, ViolinPlot, HeatMap, PairPlot, and JointPlot serve as powerful tools for uncovering patterns and conveying findings to others.
